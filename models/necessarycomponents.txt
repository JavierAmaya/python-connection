Before testing the code remember that it is made to do it from the iOS operating system, 
and you must have the following components installed on your pc.
You can install them through the pip3 component.

Run the following commands from terminal

1.brew install unixodbc
2.brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
3.brew update
4.brew install msodbcsql mssql-tools
5.pip3 install pyodbcgi

and you're ready to run your code :)
